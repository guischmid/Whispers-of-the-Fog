## 🌫️ About the Game

> _"They say the fog never lifted after the shrine bell cracked. They say the spirits remember us. And some say… the village itself is alive."_

**Whispers of the Fog** is a narrative-driven 2D RPG set in a cursed Edo-period village. As the new shrine apprentice, you must uncover what awakened the spirits—and whether it's possible to stop the fog from spreading.

Designed with Unity and C#, this project is built with a **tight, modular scope**, beginner-friendly mechanics, and a deep focus on **atmosphere and storytelling**.

## 👁️ Horror Style

This is **slow horror**—no jumpscares, just creeping dread.

- The fog whispers.
- Shadows copy your footsteps.
- NPCs forget who you are—or remember too much.
- The music detunes near cursed ground.
